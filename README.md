# CF Agent Demo

This is a demo Cloudflare Agent that showcases how to build a chat-based AI assistant using Cloudflare Workers, the Agents framework, and various AI providers.

In this demo, the agent is configured to use both OpenAI and Google Generative AI models to provide responses. It also includes a set of tools that the agent can use to enhance its capabilities, such as fetching weather information and scheduling tasks.

I built a small parser to support basic math calculations using the `calc-js` library, demonstrating how to extend the agent's functionality with custom tools.
